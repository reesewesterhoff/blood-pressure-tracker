AI Reasoning:
- Ask clarifying questions when multiple implementation paths are available and the best choice isn't obvious
- Present trade-offs between different approaches with their pros and cons
- Confirm understanding of requirements before implementing complex features
- Suggest alternatives when a requested approach might lead to performance or security issues
- Request context about existing patterns in the codebase when implementing new features
- Prioritize consistency with existing codebase patterns
- Consider scalability implications for database schema design
- Balance between performance optimization and code maintainability
- Evaluate security implications of implementation choices
