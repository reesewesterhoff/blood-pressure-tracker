TypeScript Code Style:
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer types over interfaces except for public APIs
- Create precise types that reflect your data models
- Avoid using 'any' or 'unknown' types; look for type definitions in the codebase
- Avoid type assertions with 'as' or '!' operators unless absolutely necessary
- Use mapped and conditional types for advanced type transformations
- Export types from a central location for reuse
