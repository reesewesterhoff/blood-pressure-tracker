MongoDB Patterns:
- Design schemas with proper indexing for performance
- Use MongoDB aggregation pipelines for complex data transformations
- Implement proper error handling for database operations
- Follow data validation patterns at both application and database levels
- Consider document size limits when designing schemas
- Use MongoDB transactions for operations that require atomicity
- Implement pagination for large datasets
